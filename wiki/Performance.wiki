#summary Performance comparison with other Hadoop solutions

= Introduction =

My experiment shows that hadoop-stream-mapReduce is slower than the native Hadoop Java mode. 

= Details =

I setup a single node Hadoop cluster on my MacBook Pro following the steps explained by 

[http://www.michael-noll.com/wiki/Running_Hadoop_On_Ubuntu_Linux_%28Single-Node_Cluster%29]

I downloaded three ebooks as suggested in above essay as the testing data.
Then I ran the standard Hadoop example, !WordCount, for two times using native Hadoop; and then ran the word_count_mapper/reducer delivered with hadoop-stream-mapreduce for two times.

Two runs of !WordCount cost 44sec and 37sec respectively, whereas two runs of hadoop-stream-mapreduce cost 56sec and 48sec.
